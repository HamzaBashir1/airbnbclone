      <h1 className='font-bold text-3xl mb-4'>How AirCover for guests works</h1>

      <p className='mb-4'>AirCover for guests provides support for serious issues with your booking (example: Host cancellation within 30 days of check-in) or during your stay (example: The heat going out in winter, the listing has fewer bedrooms than listed, itâ€™s a different type of homeâ€”a private room instead of an entire home, a major advertised amenity such as a pool or kitchen is missing) but it doesnâ€™t include more minor inconveniences, like a broken toaster.</p>

      <p className='mb-8'>
          Your Host is your best point of contact to reach out to if anything comes up. You can
          <span className='underline'> message your Host </span>
          directly to let them know whatâ€™s going on.
      </p>

      <p className='mb-8'>
          If an issue does come up during your stay:
          <ol className="list-decimal pl-5">
              <li className='mb-2'>Take photos or videos of the issue, if you can.</li>
              <li className='mb-2'>Contact your Host within 72 hours of discovering the problem and describe the issue to them to see if they can resolve it.</li>
              <li className='mb-2'>If your Host canâ€™t resolve the issue or doesnâ€™t respond at all,<span className='underline'> contact us</span> as soon as possible. </li>
              <li className='mb-2'>Weâ€™ll review it and if we find itâ€™s an issue thatâ€™s supported by AirCover for guests and youâ€™d like to leave the place, weâ€™ll help you find a similar place to stay, depending on availability at comparable pricing. If a similar place isnâ€™t available or youâ€™d prefer not to rebook, weâ€™ll give you a full or partial refund.</li>
